** 7- What will the following code print out?**

smallest_so_far = -1
for the_num in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
   if the_num < smallest_so_far :
      smallest_so_far = the_num
print(smallest_so_far)
Hint: This is a trick question and most would say this code has a bug - so read carefully

1) -1
2) 74
3) 42
4) 3
Answer is 1) -1

** 8- What is a good statement to describe the is operator as used in the following if statement:**
